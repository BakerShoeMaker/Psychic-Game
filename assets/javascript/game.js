//Output - Create question
    //1) <p> The word is _______________ ? </p>
    //2) <p> Try and guess 1 letter of the word I'm and thinking! </p>
    //3) <p> Enter the letter on your keyboard </p>
        //4) <p> Number of Guesses Remaining: </p>
        //5) <p> Letters Already Guessed: </p> push letters guess into an array (array.push()).

//*After the user wins/loses the game should automatically choose another word and make the user play it.

//Create logic for figuring out letter typed in.
    //1 If letter typed in === letter in word
            //Do something here.

    //2 If letter typed in != letter in word
            //Do something here.

    //Check to see if number of guesses = 9
            //If === 9 then game over.

                //If game over then stop (add
            //If they guess the whole word then ("Yeah! You are awesome!, then start over, reset the variables).


//Output - Provide the answers
